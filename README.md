## Core Project Goals
* Unify all transportation and logistics data source
* Single client UI for logistics processes
* Combine multiple map data to handle order routing
* Real-time GPS tracking
* Travel route analysis
* Operational task processing


## Project Status
This is an experimental platform; however the logic and ideas have been previously tested
in different forms of disjointed applications.


## Project Roadmap

There are a some modules supported. Most of them are configurable via the web
interface or mobile app. A few of them are:
